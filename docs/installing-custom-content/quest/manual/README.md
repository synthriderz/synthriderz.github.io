> Learn how to install content on your Quest device with a file manager

## Supported Content

For guidance on finding custom content, check out the modding community: [https://discord.synthriderz.com](https://discord.synthriderz.com)

The following custom content is supported on Quest:

- Custom Songs
- Playlists
- Stages

> Avatars and Mods are not supported on Quest.

## Connect Quest Device

For this method, we will be connecting the Quest as a USB storage device.

1. Connect the Quest to your computer with the included USB cable
2. Put on your headset and select **Accept** to confirm that you want to allow your computer to access files on the headset.
    - On Windows, your headset will automatically appear as a drive on your computer.
    - On Mac, you'll need to install [Android File Transfer](https://www.android.com/filetransfer/) to successfully transfer files between your Oculus Quest and computer.
    - On Chromebook/Chrome OS, you'll need to use the Files app to access your Oculus Quest headset.
3. You can now click and drag files to or from your Oculus Quest headset on your computer.

If you are having any problems seeing your device, please try the [troubleshooting steps here](https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/using-your-headset/transfer-files-from-computer-to-headset/).

### Install Content

Using a file manager connected to your Quest device, **navigate to the Synth Riders directory**:  
`SynthRidersUC`  
This directory is found at the top level of the Quest filesystem

Within this directory, custom content can be installed to the following locations:

| Content Type     | Folder         | File Type                                         |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Custom Songs** | `CustomSongs`  | `.synth`                                          |
| **Stages**       | `CustomStages` | PC: `.stage` or `.spinstage` Quest: `.stagedroid` |
| **Playlists**    | `Playlist`     | `.playlist`                                       |
