Install Custom Content from your PC through a USB-C cable to your Quest:

### Step 2 (alternative option): Manually download custom content to a PC, Mac, or Chromebook and copy to Quest over USB
> It's posssible to copy custom content to your Quest through a USB cable much like copying files to a thumb drive. This method is not always reliable, and is not as convenient as other methods for daily updates, but can work well for ocassional use.
- See: [Manually download](/installing-custom-content/quest/manual/) custom content to a PC, Mac, or Chromebook and copy to Quest over USB

### Step 2 (alternative option): Install a Quest File Manager that does not need Developer Mode
> Mobile VR Station is available through the official Quest Store and includes a file manager that can access the folders we need without developer mode. 
Some of this functionary was removed by Meta, but there is a workaround.
1. Install [Mobile VR Station(https://www.meta.com/experiences/mobile-vr-station/3887008398005125/) from the Quest Store (free install)
2. Follow this walk-through to install the specific release that works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEav_ie0s2Y
    - While not strictly neecessary, we highly recommend installing SideQuest now while you can! Meta may make it much more difficult in the future.
3. Manually download individual custom content files from [Synthriderz](https://synthriderz.com) from the Quest Browser.
    - All downloaded files will be in the `downloads` folder on your Quest.
4. On first launch, grant permission to `Manage All Files`
5. Use Mobile VR Station to move Custom Content to the appropriate subfolders in SynthridersUC.

### Step 2 (alternative option) Use PC Sidequest to Install a 3rd Party File Manager with Wireless and Cloud Support
> Install a 3rd party File Manager with advanced features like .zip support and wireless file transfer capability to wirelessly copy custom content files from a PC or cloud storage location. 
> This method is less common now that specialized apps have been developed but is still very useful for mappers and stage builders.
1. Follow [SideQuest's Official Installation Instructions](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) to install and configure [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) on your PC 
2. Download the `.apk` file for the File Manager of your choice.
      \- _We recommend [X-Plore by lonelycat](http://www.lonelycatgames.com/apps/xplore) as it directly supports .zip files, plus LAN, FTP, and multiple cloud storage services (Including Google Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive)._
    - At the bottom of the X-Plore page, you can grab the most recent `.apk` where it says "Download Older Versions", or [Download (v4.44) APK here](https://www.lonelycatgames.com/download/x-plore_4-44-apk?wpdmdl=3349&refresh=68ecee85656da1760358021) 
3. Launch SideQuest on your PC
4. Connect your Quest headset to your PC with a USB-C data cable
5. Put on your Quest and enable Quest Debugging. SideQuest should now show your Quest is Connected.
6. Select the `Install apk file from folder on your computer` icon. It is in the upper right and looks like a folder with a down-arrow.
7. Select the file browser .apk you downloaded, and install it.
8. You should now see this file browser listed under `Unknown Applications` on the App List
9. Open the file browser. Grant permission to 'Manage All Files` when prompted.

#### Step 3 (for file browers only): How to manually install custom content
1. If your content was downloaded in a `.zip` file, open the zip to see the included files.
2. Move the downloaded content files from the Downloads filter to the appropriate SynthridersUC folder.  
   Make sure to install content is the correct version and in the correct subfolder based on the file type:

| Content Type     | Folder         | File Type                                         |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Custom Songs** | `SynthridersUC/CustomSongs`  | `.synth`                            |
| **Custom Stages**| `SynthridersUC/CustomStages` | `.stagedroid`                       |
| **Playlists**    | `SynthridersUC/Playlist`     | `.playlist`                         |

!> **Unzip first!**  
If you have downloaded any `.zip` content from the site, make sure to unzip it first before moving it to the correct locations above.  
You may then remove the original `.zip` file from your Quest

_Avatars, mods, and .stage, .spinstage, and .stagequest files are not presently supported on Quest and will be ignored by the game._
