# Mapping For Different Difficulty Levels

> Factors that affect a map's difficulty, and recommendations for adjusting each difficulty level

It's helpful to first understand two scientific concepts that drive many of the unique characteristics of each difficulty level.
- **Strength** Our bodies build muscle strength through exercise and repetition, and players quite literally become stronger by the very act of playing. Exceeding a player's physical capacity to move is not only frustrating, but a significant risk of injury.
- **Muscle memory** is our brain rewiring itself through repetition and practice to become more efficient at tasks and lets us do things without thinking about it. A map that is too complex for a player with less muscle memory can be overwhelming and frustrating.

## Major contributors to a map's difficulty.

### Note density

The more notes per second you need to hit, the more difficult it will be for players to keep up. Newer players need time to see a note, then coordinate their motion to reach it. They will not focus as much on upcoming notes until the current one is hit. Experienced players can more easily read several notes in advance and plan out their motions.

### Motion speed and acceleration

The speed and force of motions also contributes significantly to the difference between difficulties. Synth Riders attracts a wide variety of players with a wide variety of physical abilities.  Newer players will want to ease into the game with slow and smooth motions that don't quickly redirect very often. Experienced players quite literally build muscle strength through exercise while playing and will want a more brisk pace of movement with bursts of high speed more exciting: Not everyone will be able to move as fast as you can!

Movements that require abrupt changes of direction, rapid acceleration, or rapid decceleration require significant strength and players trying to keep up can be placed at increased risk of injury. It is important to be very careful mapping movements that require high levels of acceleration and to keep speed and acceleration consistant with the norms for each difficulty level.

Note: While Rhythm is scored on precision, Force requires players to maintain a minimum speed through notes. Static patterns with notes in straight lines or only slight movement that are easy to score well in Rhythm can frustrate Force players. While mapping priorities for movements in lower difficulty levels should always prioritize Rhythm, elements with little/no motion should should be avoided at Master difficulty level where Force play is more common. Design of some elements can help make a lower difficulty map an effectively higher difficulty in Force than Rhythm.

The scale of a pattern can impact difficulty. For example, a spiral can be made less difficult by decreasing its radius - or by slowing the spiral down. 

### Reach

Player height varies, and calibration will re-center around the player's head, but the playspace will never be smaller than 1.0 roomscale. Different controller designs can come into play, too. Tall mappers will want to take special care: 
- To ensure shorter players are able to reach high reach notes
- That the spread between two notes does not exceed a player's reach with arms spread
- Not all players are fully mobile and many play seated, especially at lower difficulty levels

Some additional considerations for placing notes:
- Avoid placing notes in the extreme upper and lower corners of maps, as they are very diffficult to reach. 
- Notes directly over a player's head are relatively easy to reach
- Single notes can comfortably be placed further out than two-handed specials as players can twist their bodies and shoulders to reach with one hand in ways that is not possible when trying to reach with both hands.
- Crossover positions (placing notes opposite the normal hand) are more difficult to reach than notes on the same side as the hand. 

On lower difficulty levels, players should be allowed more time to reach notes on the outside of the comfort grid, and faster movements should stay closer to the middle of the play space. On harder difficulty levels, the outer edges of the comfort guide are great places for impactful motion.

Players must move faster to reach notes that are further away, which can create strain on the player's body. This is especially important for lower difficulty maps where the play is not looking or thinking ahead, and is only reacting after they have played the previous note.

### Two handed complexity

Just what each of the player's hands can be doing at the same time is probably the single largest diference between difficulty levels in Synth Riders. 
- Complex independent two-handed movement requires significant muscle memory and experience to accomplish. 
- The type of movements that many mappers find very fun in Master maps is impossible for newer players to follow. But higher level players may find simple patterns boring.

Some additional considerations for two-handed movements
- Non-symmetrical two handed patterns can be tricky for newer players to handle, as are crossed over two handed notes. Use them sparingly if at all at lower difficulties. 
- Notes require precise movements to hit. Playing a rail that has already started requires less precision and is easier to play. The difficulty of movement for the 2nd had can be adjusted for difficulty by varying the speed of a movement and the distaance from the player.
- Complex independant two-handed movements that require fast precise movements are the hardest in the game. are Rails require less Ensure there is sufficient space for the player has time to read the pattern and plan their motion. As the difficulty level goes up, you can add longer and more varied two handed note patterns.  

Complex independent two-handed movements that require extreme precision through densely mapped fast movements are the most challenging in the game and can often frustrate even top-level players. Rails require less precision than notes and are often easier to play through these movements

### Walls

Walls are great for adding full body movement to a map, but newer players may have trouble reacting to a wall while hitting notes. Easier difficulties should have fewer walls and either simple note patterns or no notes at all around them. Harder difficulties can ramp up the complexity of notes around walls, as well as increase the frequency of walls. Note: If more than 200 walls are visisble in any 4 second period of time, all walls will render as wireframe. This will make walls that require dodging very difficult to see and recognize.

Wall-art can contribute to VR discomfort and vertigo. Wall art and tunnels should be avoided or used extremely sparingly at lower difficulty levels. As wall art below the play area can be particularly uncomfortable, avoid placing walls below the play area, especially in lower difficulty maps. By Master level, it can be assumed most players have at least some tolerance, but dense wall-art patterns can still cause issues for some players.  Avoid dense wall tunnels in all maps- space the walls out (timing walls to notes/beats can be particularly effective).  

Wall-art far from the play area is more 

## Difficulty guidelines
> This represents best practice for each difficulty, with some tolerance for subjectivity. Official maps released 2024 and later (Electroswing 2, 80s, 90s, Current Waves, etc) are good examples to reference for difficulty. Older official maps were less consistant, and custom maps can be wildly misrepresented in difficulty.

### Easy
> _"There is no such thing as too easy for easy!"_

The defining principal for an Easy map is that it must be playable without any experience or muscle memory.  Expect Easy level players to have to make a conciously recognize and think about every note, and make a concious deliberate thought to move the correct hand (or hands) towards it. Most players, even those who are new to video gams and VR, will find hand/eye coordination natural, but expect they will only be able to concentrate on one thing at a time. Anyone should be able to play an Easy map without failing. 
- Note density should be low â€” stick to downbeats, and on higher tempo songs, remove notes on less accented beats to give the player time to read upcoming notes.
- Motions should be relatively slow, and give players plenty of time to lean towards the edge of the comfort circle as the patterns move there.
- Patterns should be simple and mostly one-handed, although some symmetrical two handed patterns can work if there is extra space beforehand to read them.
- Do not use crossed over two handed notes
- Do not map beyond the yellow comfort circle.
- Two-handed special may be used, but give a lot of extra space (typically at least two full measures) before starting a two-handed special pattern.
- Two-handed special may be used, but very sparingly. Give a lot of extra space (typically at least two full measures) before starting a two-handed special.
- Do not make players suddenly reach to the opposite side of their body. It's best to start patterns off on the natural side of the hand and slowly move around the play space.
- Keep the player's hands well away from their face, including the likely path their hands will take betweeen notess, we don't want players to risk their hitting their headset.
- Do not use dodge walls and notes at the same time. New players generally move way too far to avoid walls, so any walls should merely suggest movement, not force it, and there should be no fast dodge movements required.
- Keep wall art to a minimum. Walls near the play area can cause vertigo and VR sickness, and new players are especially susceptible. Do not place any walls beneath the play area. Avoid use of square or triangle tunnels, and do not place any wall art close to the play area. Some distant wall art is OK and can help make for a cool experience, especially at the end of the map when they have time to look. 
- Do not use buzzrails, tight note stacks, stacked rails, etc in Easy. The player will have no idea what this means or what to do!

If you are an experienced player making an Easy map, expect to be bored while playing it. Just make sure you have a variety of motions, even though they will be slow: It's possible to make fun dancey Easy difficulty maps, but the priority is to make it easy to play. 

### Normal
> Normal maps should play like a gentle groove. With mostly low-density one-handed patterns and relatively slow movements.

The underlying principals for a Normal map assume that the typical player is able to instinctively plan left notes, right notes, and 2-handed specials, but are only able to concentrate on one hand at a time. Expect Normal players will play to the very end of a rail, and will not start looking at the next note until the previous element has passed.
- Note density can increase compared to Easy, but patterns must be eeasily visible.
- Avoid intense motions;few Normal players have much muscle strength.
- Avoid placing notes beyond the outer edges of the yellow comfort circle.
- Do not require the player to move both hands independantly at the same time.
- Give space when changing note types so that players have time after the previous note to set up their other hand to play the next note, generally a full beat. 
- Give extra space when changing to a two-handed special
- Give even more space when changing to a one-handed special
- Patterns should be simple and mostly one-handed, although some symmetrical two handed patterns can work if there is extra space beforehand to read them.
- Avoid patterns that require independant two-handed movements
- Always start right/left notes on the natural side of the body; never start a pattern on the opposite side.
    - Making players reach across their body to play notes are OK later in a pattern, but avoid crossing deeper than about two grids.
- Generally avoid crossed over two handed notes unless the section is exceptionally slow. Sudden crossovers are difficult for inexperienced players to react to.
- Do not use cosmetic notes like buzzrails, tight note stacks, stacked rails, etc., in Normal. The player will have no idea what this means or what to do! Use only the standard note types.
- Do not use dodge walls and notes at the same time. At this difficulty, players need to focus when dodging walls and still typically move excessively far to avoid walls. Wall density should be low enough that the player has time to comfortably pivot and move.
- Do not use crouch walls and notes at the same time. Crouch walls should be raised to suggest crouching, not require crouching.
- Sudden crossovers are difficult for inexperienced players to react to. 
- Keep the player's hands well away from their face, including the likely path their hands will take betweeen notess, we don't want players to risk their hitting their headset.
- Keep wall art to a minimum. Walls near the play area can cause vertigo and VR sickness, and new players are especially susceptible. Do not place any walls beneath the play area. Avoid use of square or triangle tunnels, and do not place any wall art close to the play area. Some distant wall art is OK and can help make for a cool experience, especially at the end of the map when they have time to look. 

Normal maps allow enough movement that mappers should be able to choreograph the player to want move their core body. But Normal maps should be possible for seated players as well. Normal maps may bore an experienced player, but should still feel like they would be fun.

### Hard
> Hard maps start kicking up the complexity and intensity. They're full of complex one-handed movements with some simple independant movements of the 2nd hand. Notes and dodge walls occur together, and more wall art is common.

The underlying principals for a Hard map assume that the typical player is able to play relatively complex and fast one handed patterns mixed with simple independant movements of the other hand. The typical Hard player is expected to instantly recognize all notes and to be capable of playing fast complex single-hand patterns, but may still take some time to switch concentration between hands or patterns.
- Note density can be high, but patterns must be easily visible.
- Motions may be moderately intense, but Hard players should not be assumed to have as much muscle strength for Master-level players.
- Avoid placing notes beyond the outer edges of the red comfort circle. This is especially important for players with limited mobility, as Hard is often the highest difficulty level they're able to play.
- Avoid swapping rapidly between hands, including avoiding patterns that frequently mix special notes into regular patterns.
- When independant two-handed movements are used, the movement of secondary hand should be very simple, like a straight or slightly curved rail.  The complexity and intensity of the primary hand should be reduced slightly as well. 
- Consider using rails for the second hand, especially if the primary hand is doing intense or complicated patterns, as rails require less precision than patterns of notes and are more forgiving. (Players can miss up to 20% of a rail before it's  judged as a miss.)
- Avoid placing two-handed specials beyond the yellow comfort circle, and use slower movements than with one-handed notes.
- Ensure one-handed special may be played with either hand, and avoid placing one-handed specials byond the comfort circle. 
- Be mindful when the player's posture is restricted by the second hand, and reduce movements when the players players cannot twist their bodies to reach the note.
- Give Hard players space and time to think and set up when precision is needed on both hands simultanously, such as the first notes in a pattern including a rail for the second hand.
- Left/Right notes should still normally start on the natural side of the body, but crossovers can extend further.
- Crossover patterns should be simple offset vertically to avoid players having to twist unaturally.
- Patterns should be designed to prevent players from accidentally twisting their arms in a pretzel
    - If a pattern must be entered with one specific hand above the other to be playable, ensure the preceding note forces the player to enter in the correct orientation.
- Hard players are prone to controller collisions. Be very careful when two-handed movements require controllers to move in different directions in close proximity.
- Avoid rail patterns that intersect, adjust them to encourage players to separate their hands far enough their controllers are not at risk of collision.
- Be mindful of unmapped movements, and how players hands will move their hands to set up  for the next note.
- Avoid movements that require the player's hands to cross in front of their face at high speed. These movements risk the player striking their headset.
- Dodge walls may be used in combination with notes, but avoid complex patterns or independant two-handed movements in dodge wall sections on Hard difficulty maps.
- Use of crouch walls should be minimized; if used, they should be raised higher than the the default position to reduce the amount of crouching required.
- Avoid stacked walls in the play area that might quickly kill players; use only single walls and provide notes to regain energy..
- Use all of the comfort circle: Patterns should be fun, not stationary. 

Walls, buzzrails, and cosmetic note patterns:
- Wall art can add significantly to a Hard map, but should not be overwhelming.
- Minimize the use of wall art close to the the play area as it can cause vertigo and VR sickness, especially long tunnels. Minimize walls beneath the play area.  Most Hard level players have developed tolerance to resist VR sickness or have adjusted their comfort settings, but some players remain susceptible.
- Use buzzrails and right note stacks sparingly. Keep the buzz on the buzzrails small, and avoid placing notes on buzzrails as they can be hard for players to see. 
- Avoid "rule breaking" behaviors like mixing left and right notes with specials and other cosmetic notes. These can confuse and frustrate lower difficulty players.

Limited Mobility: Hard maps are very popular among experienced players with limited mobility, including those playing seated, playing with one arm, or playing with shoulder or elbow shoulder issues.  These players may have Master-level skills but are physically unable to play Master-level maps. Hard maps should strive to satisfy both improving players building muscle memory and experienced players with reduced mobility.
- Seated players will have difficulty playing deep crossovers.
- Players in wheelchairs will have difficulty reaching lower corners to the left and right.
- Avoid large dodge movements. If dodgewalls are used, the player should be able to dodge with small movements along the centerline.
- Seated players and players with back issues will be unable to crouch for crouch walls. Ensure there are enough notes to regain energy between elements to avoid failing.

### Expert
> Expert maps are highly complex and intense maps. These maps often feature wall-art and creative combinations of elements to create an audio-visual experience for players. Expert level maps generally require significant movement of both arms and the player's core body.

The underlying principals for an Expert level map assume the player is experienced and capable of complex independant hand movements with quickly changing patterns mixed with dodge walls, and is strong enough to make large fast movements. Expert maps and Master maps share many commonalities, but differ primarily in the degree of complexity and intensity.
- Note density can be high, and patterns may require players to look and think ahead, but notes should always be visible.
- Motions may be intense, but should still avoid movements known to represent high risk of injury.
    - Avoid repetitive jerky motions, whether that be with notes, rails, or walls
    - Avoid patterns that require players to rapidly reverse direction from one high-velocity movement to another in the opposite direction.
- Avoid placing notes more than slightly outside the red comfort circle. 
    - If the extreme left/right grid spaces are used, it should be in in large slow patterns where the player has time to adjust, or has already moved their core body to that side for other elements and is primed to make that movement. 
- Expert maps may feature swapping rapidly between hands and patterns.
- Master maps may feature complex and intense independant two-handed movements.
- Expert maps may mix two-handed special notes into regular patterns, but use should be limited. 
- Expert maps may mix one-handed special notes into regular patterns, but should be avoided in fast complex patterens where the Expert level player doesn't have enough time to think and plan.
- Expert maps should avoid patterns that require movements in the Z axis (forward/backward)
- Expert maps may include patterns that assume players will not play to the end of a long rail, but should have enough tolerance that players can still play the entire rail before having to move.
- Ensure one-handed special that can be played with either hand may be played with either hand.
    - If patterns require a player to play a one-handed special with a specific hand, ensure the pattern and lead makes it impossible for the player to play the wrong hand
    - If the player must play a one-handed special with a particular hand and it's impractical to force it, do not use a one-handed special here, use a note for that hand.
- Be mindful when the player's posture is restricted by the second hand, and reduce movements when the players players cannot twist their bodies to reach the note.
- Note patterns may start in a deep crossover.
- Patterns should be designed to prevent players from accidentally twisting their arms in a pretzel
    - Do not assume Expert level players know techniques to avoid pretzeling
    - If a pattern is intended to be entered with one specific hand above the other to be playable, ensure the preceding note forces the player to enter in the correct orientation.
- Be very careful when two-handed movements require controllers to move in high speed in different directions in close proximity.
- Avoid rail patterns that intersect, especially in fast complex sections that increase the risk of controller collision.
- Be mindful of unmapped movements, and how players hands will move their hands to set up  for the next note.
- Avoid movements that require the player's hands to cross in front of their face at high speed. These movements risk the player striking their headset.
- Dodge walls may be used in combination with complex note patterns, but note pattern complexity and intensity should be reduced as wall movements increase.
- Crouch walls should not normally be placed lower than the default position, as it can be very uncomfortable (and un-fun) for taller players or players with slight height calibration error.
    - Expect players that enjoy squats for exercise will still do deep squats.
- Most expert maps should feature rhyhmic core body movements. Use note patterns to drive core body movements like dancing left/right or down; dodge/crouch walls should normally accentuate the movement, not force it.
- Avoid stacked walls that might instantly kill players that fail to dodge them: Provide enough space between walls for players to recognize and react.
- Walls are generally harder to dodge on Quest than PCVR; consider this while testing.
- Use all of the comfort circle, and then some: Patterns should be fun, not stationary. 
- Do not blindly map patterns with equidistant notes: Note spacing should smoothly reflect _time_ between notes as the player will play them. For example, the speed of the player's hands may naturally change if a player is moving quickly in the center of a pattern, but needs space to accelerating up to speed at the start and slow down before the end. Notes should be spaced further apart in the faster portions, and close in the slower portions. This is especially important if patterns are already very intense and require high levels of strength and accleration.
- Be especially mindful of timing. Many expert level players will be sensitive to errors in offset or note timing. 

Wall Art:
- Wall art can be extravagent in Expert maps!  Remember: 200 walls of any type within any 4 second period of time will trigger a shift to wireframe. Avoid using wireframe dodgewalls.
- Many Expert-level players have developed tolerance to resist VR sickness or have adjusted their comfort settings, but some players remain susceptible. Avoid dense use of square and triangle tunnels.
- Avoid placing walls close to the play area as the color combinations of many players are reduced in contrast from most stages and can make it difficult to see notes.

Buzzrails and Cosmetic note patterns are optional, but are not expected or required. Do not use them for novelty, only to accentuate the map
- Most expert level players will need the opportunity to look at non-standard note patterns, analyze them, and understand how to play it.
- Buzzrails may be used to accentuate music but should be clear and unambiguous. They should not impede visibility of later notes or walls
- Note stacks may be used to accentuate music, but must be used carefully as they can result in a player instantly failing a map.
    - Note stack patterns patterns should be smooth with reduced complexity and intensity and be easy to follow precisely. They should not impede visibility of later notes or walls
- Expert maps may include simple cosmetic patterns mixing notes of different types and styles. 
- Avoid complex patterns mixing notes of different types and styles.
- Patterns intended to be played with both hands together should lead with a two-handed special, or have a two-handed special prominantly visible at the start of the pattern.
- If a one-handed pattern mixed with one-handed specials must be played with a particular hand, use that hand to lead the pattern, not a one-handed special

Keep Force in mind for Expert-level maps, especially if Expert is the highest difficulty level in the Custom Song.
- Minimize use of slow note stacks: Force players will likely whip their hands in circles around these patterns, which can be both very intense and very annoying- and unlikely the experience you want players to have. Some non-Force elements are acceptable, but too much can be un-fun for Force palyers.
- Avoid placing notes on buzzrails as they can be hard for players to see.
- Avoid closely packed lines of notes that require the player to make an abrupt direction change: Allow space and time for Force players to do a little flair at the corner to maintain speed. Smoothing the pattern out can also prevents injury to Rhythm players.

### Master
> Master are the most complex and intense maps in the game, and push the limit of how difficult a map can get. These maps often feature substantial wall-art and creative combinations of elements to create an audio-visual experience for players. Master level maps generally require significant movement of both arms and the player's core body.

This is the limit of how hard a map can get. There are no specific guidelines for this, other than don't push it too far by making the player do unhealthy or dangerous things (such as repetitive jerky motions, whether that be with notes, rails, or walls).

The underlying principals for a Master level map assume the player is highly experienced, capable of precise complex independant hand movements with rapidly changing patterns, and is strong enough to make very intense movements.
- Note density can be high, and patterns may require players to look and think ahead, but notes should always be visible.
- Motions may be very intense, but should still avoid movements known to represent high risk of injury.
    - Avoid repetitive jerky motions, whether that be with notes, rails, or walls
    - Avoid patterns that require players to rapidly reverse direction from one high-velocity movement to another in the opposite direction.
- Avoid placing notes more than one square beyond the outer left and right edges of the red comfort circle. 
    - If the extreme left/right grid spaces are used, it should be in in large slow patterns where the player has time to adjust, or has already moved their core body to that side for other elements and is primed to make that movement. 
- Master maps may feature swapping rapidly between hands and patterns that mix special notes into regular patterns.
- Master maps may feature complex and intense independant two-handed movements.
- Master maps may include patterns that require movements in the Z axis (forward/backward)
- Master maps may include patterns that do not allow players time to play to the end of a rail, but should have enough tolerance that players can still play 80% of the rail before having to move.
- Ensure one-handed special that can be played with either hand may be played with either hand.
    - If patterns require a player to play a one-handed special with a specific hand, ensure the pattern and lead makes it impossible for the player to play the wrong hand
    - If the player must play a one-handed special with a particular hand and it's impractical to force it, do not use a one-handed special here, use a note for that hand.
- Be mindful when the player's posture is restricted by the second hand, and reduce movements when the players players cannot twist their bodies to reach the note.
- Note patterns may start in a deep crossover.
- Patterns should be designed to prevent players from accidentally twisting their arms in a pretzel
    - Master level players can be expected to know techniques to avoid pretzeling, but must be given opportunity to do so, like breaks in a note pattern.
    - If a pattern is intended to be entered with one specific hand above the other to be playable, ensure the preceding note forces the player to enter in the correct orientation.
- Be very careful when two-handed movements require controllers to move in high speed in different directions in close proximity.
- Minimize rail patterns that intersect; there's some tolerance for this at the Master level, but they're still discouraged to reduce risk of controller collision.
- Be mindful of unmapped movements, and how players hands will move their hands to set up  for the next note.
- Avoid movements that require the player's hands to cross in front of their face at high speed. These movements risk the player striking their headset.
- Dodge walls may be used in combination with complex note patterns.
- Crouch walls should not normally be placed lower than the default position, as it can be very uncomfortable (and un-fun) for taller players or players with slight height calibration error.
    - Expect players that enjoy squats for exercise will still do deep squats.
- When possible, use note patterns to encourage movements like dodging left/right or squating; dodge/crouch walls should normaally accentuate the movement, not force it.
- Many Master level players will ignore walls to improve accuracy if they have sufficient energy.
- Most Master level maps should feature large and fast rhyhmic core body movements. Use note patterns to drive core body movements like dancing left/right or down; dodge/crouch walls should normally accentuate the movement, not force it.
- If you want to force all players to make movements, use stacked walls. Do not stack walls at 1/64 intervals: Provide enough space between walls for players to recognize and react without instantly dying.
    - Players will curse use of stacked walls, but they _will_ dodge them!
- Walls are generally harder to dodge on Quest than PCVR; consider this while testing.
- Use all of the comfort circle, and then some: Patterns should be fun, not stationary. 
- Do not blindly map patterns with equidistant notes: Note spacing should smoothly reflect _time_ between notes as the player will play them. For example, the speed of the player's hands may naturally change if a player is moving quickly in the center of a pattern, but needs space to accelerating up to speed at the start and slow down before the end. Notes should be spaced further apart in the faster portions, and close in the slower portions. This is especially important if patterns are already very intense and require high levels of strength and accleration.
- Be especially mindful of timing. Master level players tend to be especially critical of even small errors in offset or note timing. 

Wall Art, buzzrails, and other cosmetic note patterns are optional, but are not expected or required. Do not use them for novelty, only to accentuate the map.
- Wall art can be as extravagent as you like!  Remember: 200 walls of any type within any 4 second period of time will trigger a shift to wireframe. Avoid using wireframe dodgewalls.
- Most Master-level players have developed tolerance to resist VR sickness or have adjusted their comfort settings, but some players remain susceptible. Avoid dense use of square and triangle tunnels.
- Avoid placing walls close to the play area as the color combinations of many players are reduced in contrast from most stages and can make it difficult to see notes.
- Buzzrails may be used to accentuate music but should be clear and unambiguous. They should not impede visibility of later notes or walls
- Note stacks may be used to accentuate music, but must be used carefully as they can result in a player instantly failing a map.
    - Note stack patterns patterns should be smooth with reduced complexity and intensity and be easy to follow precisely. They should not impede visibility of later notes or walls
- Master-level maps may include complex cosmetic patterns mixing notes of different types and styles. 
- Patterns intended to be played with both hands together should lead with a two-handed special, or have a two-handed special prominantly visible at the start of the pattern.
- If a one-handed pattern mixed with one-handed specials must be played with a particular hand, use that hand to lead the pattern, not a one-handed special
- Provide players increased opportunity to recognize especially complex or novel cosmetic note patterns and figure out how to play them.

Keep Force in mind for Master-level maps: Even if you're not a Force player, many Master level players are.
- Minimize use of slow note stacks: Force players will likely whip their hands in circles around these patterns, which can be both very intense and very annoying- and unlikely the experience you want players to have. Some non-Force elements are acceptable, but too much can be un-fun for Force palyers.
- Avoid placing notes on buzzrails as they can be hard for players to see.
- Avoid closely packed lines of notes that require the player to make an abrupt direction change: Allow space and time for Force players to do a little flair at the corner to maintain speed. Smoothing the pattern out can also prevents injury to Rhythm players.

### Custom
> Custom difficulties have fewer expected norms. Custom difficulty levels of maps are appropriate for experimental techniques, difficulty levels above Master, or if maps are specialized for Spin or Spiral or other special modes of play.

- Press F11 to change the name and NJS of a Custom level
- Use a Custom name that players will instantly recognize and understand. If you try to use a clever name, it may not be recognized - or played. For example:
    - Master+
    - Spin360+
    - Spiral
    - OneHand
    - NoWalls
    - Seated
    - Workout
- Mappers often use Custom difficulties to experiment with things that are not generally acceptible in regular maps, like unplayable patterns. 

> Note: Players can select NJS 2x or 3x to increase the speed above what you set, but cannot make the NJS slower than what you set. Setting NJS above 2.0 or higher will prevent the normal 2x or 3x score bonus from being counted, and these will not show up on the leaderboard.
