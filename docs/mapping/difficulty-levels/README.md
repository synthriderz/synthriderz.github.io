# Mapping For Different Difficulty Levels

> Factors that affect a map's difficulty, and recommendations for adjusting each difficulty level


Things that impact difficulty

The following are major contributors to a map's difficulty.

## Note density

The more notes per second you need to hit, the more difficult it will be for players to keep up. Newer players need time to see a note, then coordinate their motion to reach it. They will not focus as much on upcoming notes until the current one is hit. Experienced players can more easily read several notes in advance and plan out their motions.

## Motion speed and acceleration

The speed and force of motions also contributes significantly to the difference between difficulties. Synth Riders attracts a wide variety of players with a wide variety of physical abilities.  Newer players will want to ease into the game with slow and smooth motions that don't quickly redirect very often. Experienced players quite literally build muscle strength through exercise while playing and will want a more brisk pace of movement with bursts of high speed more exciting: Not everyone will be able to move as fast as you can!

Movements that require abrupt changes of direction, rapid acceleration, or rapid decceleration require significant strength and players trying to keep up can be placed at increased risk of injury. It is important to be very careful mapping movements that require high levels of acceleration and to keep speed and acceleration consistant with the norms for each difficulty level.

Note: While Rhythm is scored on precision, Force requires players to maintain a minimum speed through notes. Static patterns with notes in straight lines or only slight movement that are easy to score well in Rhythm can frustrate Force players. While mapping priorities for movements in lower difficulty levels should always prioritize Rhythm, elements with little/no motion should should be avoided at Master difficulty level where Force play is more common. Design of some elements can help make a lower difficulty map an effectively higher difficulty in Force than Rhythm.

## Reach

On easier difficulty levels, it should take more time to reach the outside of the comfort grid, and faster movements should stay closer to the middle of the play space. On harder difficulty levels, the outer edges of the comfort guide are great places for impactful motion.

## Two handed complexity

Complex independant two-handed movement requires significant muscle memory to accomplish and is quite literally impossible for newer players to do. The complexity of two-handed movements is the single largest defining feature of difficulty levels in Synnth Riders. Non-symmetrical two handed patterns can be tricky for newer players to handle, as are crossed over two handed notes. Use them sparingly if at all at lower difficulties — ensure there is some space before such a pattern so that the player has time to read the pattern and plan their motion. As the difficulty level goes up, you can add longer and more varied two handed note patterns.  

Complex independant two-handed movements that require extreme precision through densely mapped fast movements are the most challenging in the game and can often frustrate even top-level players. Rails require less precision than notes and are often easier to play through these movements

## Walls

Walls are great for adding full body movement to a map, but newer players may have trouble reacting to a wall while hitting notes. Easier difficulties should have fewer walls and either simple note patterns or no notes at all around them. Harder difficulties can ramp up the complexity of notes around walls, as well as increase the frequency of walls. Note: If more than 200 walls are visisble in any 4 second period of time, all walls will render as wireframe. This will make walls that require dodging very difficult to see and recognize.

Wall-art can contribute to VR discomfort and vertigo. Wall art and tunnels should be avoided or used extremely sparingly at lower difficulty levels. As wall art below the play area can be particularly uncomfortable, avoid placing walls below the play area, especially in lower difficulty maps. By Master level, it can be assumed most players have at least some tolerance, but dense wall-art patterns can still cause issues for some players.  Avoid dense wall tunnels in all maps- space the walls out (timing walls to notes/beats can be particularly effective).  

Wall-art far from the play area is more 

## Difficulty guidelines

Most mappers find it easiest to create a map at the highest intended difficulty, then copy it to a lower difficulty and make edits to decrease the difficulty. The following guidelines will give you a rough idea of how hard each difficulty should be.

## Easy

The defining feature of an Easy map is that it is playable without any muscle memory.  Easy level players have to make a concious deliberate thought about each and every note, and concious deliberate thought to move the correct hand (or hands) towards it. Most players, even those who are new to video gams and VR, will find hand/eye coordination natural, but can only concentrate on one thing at a time. Anybody (including players who are new to video games and VR) should be able to pick up an Easy map and get through it without failing. 
- Note density should be low — stick to downbeats, and on higher tempo songs, remove notes on less accented beats to give the player time to read upcoming notes.
- Motions should be slow, and give players plenty of time to lean towards the edge of the comfort grid as the patterns move there.
- Patterns should be simple and mostly one-handed, although some symmetrical two handed patterns can work if there is space beforehand to
read them.
- Do not use crossed over two handed notes.
- Do not use one-handed specials
- Two-handed special may be used, but very sparingly. Give a lot of extra space (typically at least two full measures) before starting a two-handed special.
- As with Normal difficulty, do not make players suddenly reach to the opposite side of their body. It's best to start patterns off on the natural side of the hand and slowly move around the play space.

If you are an experienced player making an Easy map, expect to be bored while playing it. Just make sure you have a variety of motions, even though they will be slow: It's possible to make fun dancey Easy difficulty maps, but the priority is to make it easy to play. There is no such thing as too easy for easy.

## Normal

This difficulty should play like a gentle groove. Note density should be quite low, so consider removing the notes between downbeats. Intense motions should be replaced with gentle ones that take time to reach the outer edges of the comfort grid. Avoid tricky two handed patterns.
Don't make the player suddenly reach to the opposite side of their body — instead, start on the natural side of the hand and direct the pattern over. Sudden crossovers are difficult for inexperienced players to react to. Try to remove crossed over two handed notes unless the
section is slow enough that the player will have time to react to them.

At this difficulty, players need to focus when dodging walls, so consider removing notes that are around them. Wall density should be low enough that the player has time to comfortably pivot and move.

## Hard

This should be much easier than Expert. Intense sections should have noticeably slower motions and decreased note density. It should take some time to reach the outside of the comfort grid at this difficulty. Two handed patterns should be simple, and you shouldn't swap between
hands too often in a short time.

## Expert

Similar to Master, but reach is brought in a little bit, and the most complex patterns are simplified. This can be achieved by slowing the motions and/or simplifying some two handed patterns (either by removing a hand, making it more symmetrical, or uncrossing some crossed over
notes).

## Master

This is the limit of how hard a map can get. There are no specific guidelines for this, other than don't push it too far by making the player do unhealthy or dangerous things (such as repetitive jerky motions, whether that be with notes, rails, or walls).

## Custom

Often used for Master+ difficulty levels, specialized Spin maps or specialized Spiral maps. This is also the place to experiment and do things that are not generally acceptible in regular maps, like unplayable patterns. It is best to use a standard recognizable name mlike "Master+" or "360+Wild" that players will instantly recognize and understand. If you try to use a clever name, it may not be recognized - or played.

Players can just NJS 2x or 3x to increased the speed above what you set, but cannot make the NJS slower than what you set. Setting NJS above 2.0 or higher will prevent the normal 2x or 3x score bonus from being counted, and these will not show up on the leaderboard.
